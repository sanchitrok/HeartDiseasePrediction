# HeartDiseasePrediction
Cleaned the dataset and performed EDA to understand relationship between different variables with respect to target variable  whether a person has heart disease or not. Fitted KNN model using optimal neighbors and calculated accuracy using confusion matrix as well as built visualization for training set and test set based on the prediction made. Applied Naive Bayes model and using confusion matrix checked accuracy for prediction made also generated visualization for test set based on underlying prediction and improved accuracy by ~10% from KNN model prediction
